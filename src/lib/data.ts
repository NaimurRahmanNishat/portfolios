      "Back-end development covers server-side web application logic and integration and activities, like writing APIs, creating libraries, and working with system components instead of frontend development, which focuses on customer-facing services and programs. Backend developers build code that allows a database and an application to communicate with one another. Backend developers take care and maintain the back-end of a website, Including databases, servers, and apps, and they control what you don't see. A backend developer's job entails focusing on website architecture, scripting, and writing code that communicates between the websiteâ€™s database and the user's browser. Data consistency and integrity must be ensured. A backend developer creates code that does relational mapping to retrieve data from a database. MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL SERVER, MongoDB, and Oracle Database are some of the most widely used DBMS. NodeJS and ExpressJS are examples of JavaScript environments. Python is the most widely used programming language. It's adaptable and simple to use. Backend development is done with Python frameworks like Django and Flask.",

      "A software developer is an individual whose primary job is designing, developing and implementing different computer programs and applications. Companies across all industries rely on software developers to create software solutions that allow businesses to operate efficiently and provide useful services to customers. This comprehensive article explains the roles and responsibilities of software developers. Software developers start by consulting with clients, managers or stakeholders to understand their needs and the specific requirements for the new software. Once the requirements are established, developers carefully plan out the architecture and structure of the software program. This is where software developers write the actual code that will make the software work as intended. They use various programming languages like Java, C++, Python, JavaScript etc., based on the type of software being built. The software is then integrated with other relevant programs, databases or platforms as required. Once all testing is complete, software developers deploy or release the fully functional software so it is accessible to end-users. Software requires continuous maintenance and upgrades over time. Developers are responsible for managing existing software by fixing bugs, enhancing features, improving performance and adding new functionalities as requirements change.",
